    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>To the reader, <br> Welcome to my portfolio, Currently my personal portfolio is pretty bare. But soon it should take on a much more advanced look. My name is Michael Larragueta, and im currently finishing up my first week at epicodus. My coding experience all started about 4 years ago when i took my first class. COMSC 101: Into to c++. I loved every minute of it. 4 years of studying c++ later I figured I really needed some other languages under my belt if I wanted to branch out and expand my knowledge. Currently I am 25 years old and I am not being graded based on the informaation i put here. I should get back to my code and continue to build this website. One day i will come back and make this filled with better information. But for now this looks fine for the time being. If youre one of my teachers at epicodus and youre actually reading this information i just want to say hi, and thankyou for you help. Sorry you had to read this. Have a good day.<br> <br> Thank you,
      <br> -Michael Larragueta</p>
